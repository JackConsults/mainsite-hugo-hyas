## Prelimiary Thoughts

I've been wanting to start my own non profit like consulting company on the side for a while. Not necessary to make extra money on the side, but more to give back with my area of expertise. I also want to be able to become a customer to some of my busienss to business clients. Finally I also want to keep myself updated with the latest technical patterns and website strategies I can best achieve with my own company.

## Business Strategy and Key Performance Indicators

Unlike most for profit companies that has key performance indicators thats' tied to a clear strategy and growth plan, I do not hae that.

Instead I have the following:

- Take this opportunity learn what it takes to acquire potentially interested customers. Take a personal deep dive into SEO and advertisement.  
- Start to do valuable work and be humble.
- Help my new clients achieve succses.
